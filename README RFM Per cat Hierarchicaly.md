Selects the customer ID, order ID, and other relevant information from the "Sales_order_item" table into a temporary table "#sales".

Calculates the RFM values for the customers based on the category level 1 and stores the results in a temporary table "#sales_categorylevel1".

Calculates the RFM values for the customers based on the category level 2 and stores the results in a temporary table "#sales_categorylevel2".

Calculates the RFM values for the customers based on the leaf and stores the results in a temporary table "#sales_Leaf".

Drops the "#sales" temporary table.

Calculates the quintiles for the RFM values of each category level and stores the results in the "CustomerRFMperCategoryLevelOne" table.
